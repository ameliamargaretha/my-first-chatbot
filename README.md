# (Very) Simple Chatbot

In this project I try creating a simple chatbot in:
1. English (source: https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-chatbot-project/)
2. Bahasa Indonesia (source: https://github.com/kunci115/siPintar)

For the English chatbot (which I called Shu-Bot ðŸ˜‚) I used Keras and NLTK for the stemming, meanwhile for the Bahasa one I used TensorFlow and Sastrawi package. 

I also provided a GUI for interactive purpose, so feel free to play around! But please note that the chatbot ability to hold a conversation is very minimal (in other words -- they are stupid). yes.
